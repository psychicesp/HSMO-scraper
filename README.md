# HSMO-scraper
 Adopted an adorable little puppy, but our other dog wasn't into her and we had to give her back.  She is the calmest, smartest, sweetest little puppy, and I wasn't onna feel good about giving her up until I found out she found a new home, so I made this scraper to check on her status.
