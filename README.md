# HSMO-scraper
 Adopted an adorable little puppy, but our other dog wasn't into her and we had to give her back.  She is the calmest, smartest, sweetest little puppy, and I wasn't gonna feel good about giving her up until I found out she found a new home, so I made this scraper to check on her status.
 
 She was put up for adoption again next day and adopted within hours :)
 
 Still running the scraper because I think the data set could be interesting. Currently retooling it to work an a raspberry pi with limited RAM.
